# Lab6
# First off, we began by asking the user to input their name through the variable name.

# In the second part of the exercise, I am asking the user to input their age and then printing a message saying "My age is" and their age. Next I asked them what their friend's age is and then printing another statement saying " My friend's age is" and their age. Finally, I found the sum of their age and their friend's age and then printed another print statement saying "The sum of my friend's age and mine is " and then the total of their ages.
